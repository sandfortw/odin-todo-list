# odin-todo-list
My solution to The Odin Project's to-do list project.

Live Preview: https://sandfortw.github.io/odin-todo-list/

This project was to get further practice with CRUD operations in javascript, as well as using localStorage to save user data. 

Users can create to-do lists by adding projects. When a project is selected, they can add tasks to those projects. Tasks can be updated. 

Projects (with tasks) are saved in localStorage, so if you leave the page and return, your lists will persist.
